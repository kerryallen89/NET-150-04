Lab 7.1: VLSM
Summary:
- In this lab, I created 5 seperate networks utilizing PCs. Laptops, a printer, and a server. I then connected between two different routers. One in North America and the other Mumbai.

Questions:
The thing that gave the most difficulty was probably setting up the networks properly. The routers gave me trouble especially with the Serial DTE cable. 
Lessons I learned that can be used in the future is subnetting optimally to efficiently use resources.
