Lab 4-2: Simple Routing Lab

Summary:
 - In this lab, I set up a multilayer switch between 3 PCs and ping each computer through the multilayer switch. I would also set up IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways for each PC. 
 
 Lab questions:
 - What is a subnet mask? - a 32-bit address that segregates an IP address into network bits that identify the network and host bits that identify the host device operating on that network.
 - What is a Default Gateway - the path used to pass information when the device doesn't know where the destination is. More directly, a default gateway is a router that connects your host to remote network segments.
 
 Problems I had with Lab:
 - Pinging PC1 from PC0 with simulation panel recording wouldn't show the ping going to PC1 despite the ping being successful. 
 - Pinging would often freeze kinda at the end of the lab and then work. But it never recorded in Simulation Panel. I was able to get two recording on simulation panel before it broke.
